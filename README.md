# Identification of The Authenticity of Signatures Using The Federated Learning Method

Signature is a sign as a symbol of the name written by the person's own hand as a personal marker. So far, to identify the authenticity of the signatures must be done manually one another. This will be very challenging if there are thousands or millions of signatures that must identify their authenticity in a certain time frame. In this case, the process of assisting signature authenticity was applied using the federated learning method. Every federation learning round runs by sending an initial learning model in the form of a convolutional neural network to the client from the server and then training is carried out by two client with 10 epochs and the learning performance parameters are sent to the server to be combined. Federation learning rounds in this study were twice. In my case, Client 1 stores 941 data images for the learning process and 252 data images for the testing process while client 2 stores 708 images for the learning process and 248 iamges for the testing process. Based on the test results, each client is able to learn with local data and achieve an accuracy of up to 99%.
